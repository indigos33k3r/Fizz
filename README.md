## Why Fizz?

Cuz its worth it! 

* Open source, of course
* Uses CPU power
* No install
* No signup (for a separate miner)
* Live stats
* Flawless responsive design
* Free (No Pro Plans)



## Inspiration

This project is inspired by [Monerite](https://electronjs.org/apps/monerite) Project. The gradient animation background was also inspired by the same

The logo is actually not mine. It all started like this....... I was searching for some logo design ideas for this project so that I could make one myself. I saw this icon and thought this is a perfect one. Then I started thinking how to remake it and my brain was blank. It was the perfect icon that matches the theme, perfect color, perfect font, perfect design. The REAL owner of this icon is [Fizz Creative](http://hellofizz.com/about).
