4. Miner will notify you that the miner has started, meanwhile have a drink:beer: ...Cheers!
5. When you are up, press `N` key to stop the miner

**NOTE:** If you get the "AdBlocker Detected" warning, just disable your ad blocking program (in cases if it is your antivirus, allow the blocked object) and reload your the page. So simple... isn't it?
