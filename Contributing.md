# Contributing Guidelines

Thanx for taking the time to contribute!
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Fizz.
These are just guidelines, not rules, so use your best judgement and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.
You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers or owner.
if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Issues
Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [issues](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/issues).
If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the bug, open a [new issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/issues/new).

Please pay attention to the following points while opening an issue.

### Write detailed information
Detailed information is very helpful to understand an issue. 

- How to reproduce the issue, step-by-step.
- The expected behavior (or what is wrong).
- Screenshots for issue(s).
- The web browser.
- The operating system.
- Server application (if using)

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are always welcome
Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. It should include:

- The web browser on which you tested.
- The operating system on which you tested.
- The relevant issue number, if applicable.

###Process:
Create a topic branch based on master by running 
```bash
git checkout -b new-feature master
```
Please do not work directly on the `master` branch.

You should use a verbose enough name for your branch so it is clear what it is about.

When you are ready to generate a pull request, push your local topic branch back up to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin fix-broken-thing
```
